# Visualize Things Companion

Optional PC companion app to [Visualize Things](https://github.com/jiink/Visualize-Things)

This lets you pair a Quest, then drag and drop 3D models to have them immediately get transfered and shown in MR on a paired Quest running the Visualize Things app.

By the way the working title was "Realivation"; that name hasn't been gotten rid of in the code entirely yet.
